Description: DNSDB query tool
 dnsdbq constructs and issues queries to the Farsight DNSDB and displays
 responses. It is commonly used as a production command line interface to
 the DNSDB API server.
 DNSDB is a database that stores and indexes both the passive DNS data
 available via Farsight Security's Security Information Exchange as well
 as the authoritative DNS data that various zone operators make available.
 DNSDB makes it easy to search for individual DNS RRsets and provides
 additional metadata for search results such as first seen and last seen
 timestamps as well as the DNS bailiwick associated with an RRset. DNSDB
 also has the ability to perform inverse or rdata searches.
